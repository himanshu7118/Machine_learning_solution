    "\n",
    "To use Bayes' theorem in practice, you typically start with an initial belief (prior probability) about an event, and then update that belief based on new evidence or data (likelihood). This allows you to obtain an updated belief (posterior probability) considering the new information.\n",

    "Bayesian inference, which is built on Bayes' theorem, is widely used in various statistical applications, including hypothesis testing, parameter estimation, machine learning, and decision-making under uncertainty.\n",
